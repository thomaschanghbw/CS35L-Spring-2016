The gitk interface consists on 5 windows. The first contains a
visualization of the tree and its branches. Each branch has a very brief
description of what the commit does. The window to the right gives
author of the commit, along with a contact email. To the right of this
window contains the date and time of the commit. Below the first window
is a window that contains previews of the affected files. It is in the format
of the patch and diff output files. On the bottom right there is a toggle
window. It lets you select files and directories either related to the
patch or to the entire tree.
